As a recent graduate from UMass Lowell, I am seeking to expand my horizon as an Engineer. While a student, I had exposed myself to the various stages of product development, whether it was in the experimental, design, simulation, or testing phase. Although I have vastly expanded my knowledge and skillset throughout my academic career, I realize that there is always more to learn. I am continually developing new skills to better equip myself for solving complex engineering problems. In doing so, I am enthusiastic about working in challenging environments to drive forward innovative processes.
